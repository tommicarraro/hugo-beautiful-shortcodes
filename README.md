# hugo-beautiful-shortcodes

A beautiful collection of self-standing hugo shortcodes

# Dependencies

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): the static site generator.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): for the styling of the shortcodes.. Actually the css and js are downloaded in the assets folder, so you don't need to include the whole bootstrap library in your project.
